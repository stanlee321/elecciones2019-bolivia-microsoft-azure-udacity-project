# Computer Vision for automate the process of Elections

The intention of this work is to automate the counting of votes in the electoral records. Computer vision techniques are used to attempt to read the regions of interest and subsequently read the handwritten numbers within these regions of interest. The dataset that is accessed comes from the Bolivian elections 2019. Within this dataset whose size is 60 GB. We only worked on the images that were scanned since they are easier to process due to the computer vision agorithm that was developed. A work that is left as a potential research area is to use the labels generated by the computer vision algorithm, create a VOC like dataset and train an Object Detection model, the latter was completed but with poor results in a first iteration.


## Download the dataset.

To download the dataset of the images, the jupyter notebook called `Download_images_azure.ipynb` is used. This notebook downloads the 60 GB of information, whose categories are the following.

### uploadedimages

This images comes from a direct photo from a smartphone taked the moment where the operator in charge of the elections table must to send this report for fast counts called "TREP"

### uploadedimagescomputo

This images are the same from `uploadedimages`(TREP) but are been scanned. We take this set of images (~30GB)  for our Computer Vision work pipeline.

### imgactastrep

This set of images are been flaged as **fraudulent** by the original team that work with this images the last year, this set of images comes from the `uploadedimages` set.

## Create VOC like dataset.


###  Target Dataset

We take the `uploadedimagescomputo` set of images since this are more easy to work with Computer Vision techniques.
One example of this dataset set is this image.

Using Canny edge detection and other simple computer vision techinques we can start to get some detection of the areas of interest.

Into this image we are only interested in  detecting this region of the image.

Other parts of the image also can be used for another kind of applications, like "fingerprint" maching across the whole dataset or  read and detect duplicate names in the region of people in charge of the election table.
